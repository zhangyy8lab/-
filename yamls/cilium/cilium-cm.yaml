  # Identity allocation mode selects how identities are shared between cilium
  # nodes by setting how they are stored. The options are "crd" or "kvstore".
  # - "crd" stores identities in kubernetes as CRDs (custom resource definition).
  #   These can be queried with:
  #     kubectl get ciliumid
  # - "kvstore" stores identities in an etcd kvstore, that is
  #   configured below. Cilium versions before 1.6 supported only the kvstore
  #   backend. Upgrades from these older cilium versions should continue using
  #   the kvstore by commenting out the identity-allocation-mode below, or
